# What is a DCA-CC Calculator and How to Use it?

If you want to backtest your investment strategy, you should first have an idea of what your strategy is and how it will work.

This calculator is separated in two modes: dollar cost average calculator and lump sum investing calculator.

These two calculators allow you to provision budgeting on a regular basis or investing all your money at once.

You can use the DCA-CC to start with a given DCA or lump sum investment amount and see if it will generate the desired return over the time period, interval and investment you selected. You can also change these parameters and see how they affect your strategy.

## What is DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)?

Dollar Cost Averaging, or DCA, is a strategy used to buy more shares of an investment fund over time. This reduces the average price you pay per share, which can help prevent you from buying at too high a price. It basically means dividing your investments equally over a fixed period of time.

Dollar Cost Averaging is a technique that is used to reduce the risk of investing in a volatile market. It involves purchasing an equal dollar amount of a cryptocurrency at regular intervals, regardless of the coin price.

The risk associated with DCA is that it may take more time than other strategies to recover losses incurred by falling prices. This can be mitigated by using DCA when the market is trending upwards, and not when it's trending downwards.

## How to use DCA-CC to backtest your dollar cost average strategy?

A backtest is a simulation that tests an investment strategy on past data to see how it performs in the past. It can be used to test whether an investment strategy would have made money or not.

The DCA-CC calculator tool is designed to help you do this.

It will provide you with the results for your specific strategy, so you can compare it against other strategies and choose the best one for yourself.

When you first start out, we'll make some assumptions here when calculating your potential profit that will help you get the idea of what it might look like if you were investing over the last few years.

The assumption we are making is that you will be investing **10$** buying **bitcoin**, every **week** in the **last 3 years**.

You can easily change this by adjusting the parameters on the left side. And go from there.

## DCA Widgets

### **Top 3 cards**

Value in FIAT, BTC selling price and Total investment cards are easiest to understand. We'll try to explain them a little better though:

**What is DCA _Value in FIAT_ card*?***

This card displays the final value of your investments after the dollar cost averaging period is done. Here you can see the results of your investment over time, and this card will help you better understand how dollar cost averaging affects the value of your investment.

The scale on the lower part of this widget displays the investments to interest ratio. In other words: it shows how much of your investment is lost or how much was added to your investment due to the earnings.

**What is a DCA _selling price_ card?**

This card displays the value of the chosen cryptocurrency at the last day of your investment period - the selling price.

Together with the selling price it displays the price of your first order so you can put the market volatility into a perspective.

Finally, it displays the ratio of selling price to average price. This is helpful to showcase the value of your investment strategy and it's impact to your selling price over time.

**What is a DCA _Total Investment_ card?**

The total investment card takes your initial investment and your investment interval, then multiplies it over the time period provided.

It shows you how much money you invested over the time period of the dollar cost averaging.

### Charts

We are showing two charts here: Earnings over time & Price over time. Both charts are helpful to put things in a bigger perspective and allow you to see what would be different if you entered or exited the market at a different time.

**Earnings over time**

This chart shows a two things 1) your balance in FIAT on a given day and 2) your total investment up to that day.

**BTC price over time**

This chart shows a two things 1) Price of the give cryptocurrency and 2) the average cost of a cryptocurrency on a given day.

This chart can help you understand the value of dollar cost averaging as a strategy and how it may may impact your earnings.

### **What is Lump sum Fact?**

The "Fact" is an automated message, tailored to the investment strategy you selected, used to summarise all the information, from all the charts in a short, sharable sentence.

### **What is Profit/Loss card?**

This card is used to help you understand how often you would be making profit. This is a helpful tool to guide your risk management.

### What is Purchase history?

Here, you can find the table of purchases, with it's supplementing data, such as how much cryptocurrency you would buy on a given day with the money invested, how much would you profit or lose on a given time in history.

## What is Lump Sum Investing strategy?

A DCA-CC can be used to backtest your lump sum investment strategy. First, you need to set up the parameters for your DCA-CC. Then, you need to find a historical price series that matches the desired asset allocation and time horizon.

Next, you need to find the desired investment interval and investment size.

Finally, you need to set up the trading rules for your DCA-CC by specifying how much of each asset should be bought when rebalancing occurs.

Lump sum investing is a type of investment strategy that involves investing your entire portfolio in one investment. This is a bold strategy. If the market goes down and you're risking all your money, then you will lose it all; however, if the market goes up and you risk a lot of your money, then there's more potential to get a lot wealthier in return.

This strategy can be used by people with large portfolios to invest their entire savings in one big investment and then retire early.

### How to use DCA-CC to backtest your lump sum investment strategy?

DCA-CC is a powerful and easy to use backtesting tool that can be used to test and optimise your investment strategy.

The DCA-CC calculator can help you calculate the performance of your investment strategy across different market conditions.

You can also compare your performance against other strategies such as dollar cost averaging.

### Lump Sum Widgets

Both lump sim investment and DCA widgets are very similar, yet because the strategy we employ is different, some data here is presented differently, so we will mention only these differences here.

### **Top 3 cards**

Same as with DCA strategy, we have three cards here: Value in FIAT, BTC selling price and Total investment.

**What is a Lump sum _selling price_ card?**

This card displays the value of the chosen cryptocurrency - the selling price.

It displays the ratio of selling price to buying price. This is helpful to showcase the value of your investment strategy and it's impact to your selling price over time.

**What is a Lump sum _Total Investment_ card?**

This number will always differ from the _investment_ parameter you inserted in a calculator and there is a good reason for it.

The way we calculate the total investment card here is same as in the DCA strategy. We do this to show you the impact of investing the same amount of money, using two different strategies.

As a reminder, in the DCA strategy, the total investment card takes your initial investment and your investment interval, then multiplies it over the time period provided.
